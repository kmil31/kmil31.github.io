    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>I'm Muhammad Kamiel. Self proclaimed devil-oper and chasing performance wherever I go.
        Whether it be hardware, software, cardinal desires, and all other aspects of life,
        performance is king, speed is a sultry seductress and pointless metrics indicating
        huge numbers but absolutely no valid proof of real world performance is absolute.

       <h1>What are my skills?</h1>
       <p>I read and write very good. I also dabble in a bit of code,
         project management, risk assessments, penetration testing,
           as well as various other oddities relating to technologies. I am also 
           a below average guitarist, calisthenics athlete and budget supermodel.

    <h1>Why is this the best portfolio?</h1>
    <p> Utada Hikaru once sang a beautiful song titled 'Simple and Clean'. This song was 
        played in the opening sequence of Kingdom Hearts and it became my motto for nearly
        everything in life. This website follows the same motto, built with simple and clean 
        web technologies, Pure HTML and CSS. All those fancy Javascript Frameworks, all your NodeJS 
        libraries and builds, they are bloated, heavy and smell like big poo poo. React? Vue? Angular?
        All I see are ridiculously complex, heavy and unnecessary tech for a web that is becoming increasingly bloated.

       <h1>That sounds a lot like someone who's too stupid to use any of 
           those technologies, and thus rejecting their use.
       </h1>
       <p>That may be true. What is also true is that this website is only 3kb sopping wet and loads way faster
           than any of your pathetic punk-ass, "REACTIVE", websites. We spent most of humanity's history with books,
           why change what is already good?
