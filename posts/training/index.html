<p>I was never an athletic individual. From childhood, I was never pushed to play sports, train, or do a lot of physical activities. Even playing around on the playground was a rare moment of bliss. Instead, I spent my days staring at a screen, playing Maplestory, O2Jam, Dungeon Siege and various other computer games, which probably contributed to my disastrous eyesight.</p>
<p>All this time I wondered if people are just genetically predisposed to either be athletic or not. However, as I have branched out into the larger world, I find that this worldview is not quite accurate. Certainly some people are just naturally better suited at performing physical exercises and sports, that&rsquo;s what talent is. The average person will never get a body like prime Arnold Schwarzenegger, or be the dictator of the tennis court, like Roger Federer was. However, assuming you do not have any overtly damaging health conditions, a reasonable level of fitness is very much achievable. Below I have listed a few key points on why I think this is the case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your body adapts to training</li>
<li>Growth is stimulated by external events</li>
<li>Consistency will breed results</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="body-adaptation">Body Adaptation</h2>
<p>The human body is constantly growing, evolving, in response to any external event. This has been observed time and time again, where people with certain lifestyles, certain geographical locations, are found to have uniquely acclimated to their environment. The Inuit people, were found to have adapted to the harsh cold of their environment by having a significantly thicker layer of fat. Well this could pose health problems, their diet rich in Omega-3 fatty acids helps to counteract any health issues posed by their diet. Looking a bit more locally, we can see that the Bajau people, with their lifestyle of marine hunting and gathering, have developed an affinity for hypoxia tolerance. They are able to control the muscles of their eyes to see more clearly in water, as well as having incredible  breath control, diving for over 5 minutes at a time. Now that we have established that external events forces a body to adapt, let us move on to my second point:</p>
<h2 id="growth-stimulation">Growth Stimulation</h2>
<p>A Greek wrestler, Milo of Croton, was said to have trained by carrying a calf in his childhood. Everyday he would carry the calf, and as it grew bigger and heavier, so would Milo&rsquo;s strength. When the calf grew into a large bull, Milo was lifting it as he would when it was a calf. Milo was said to be one of the strongest men of his era, effortless tearing apart trees and lifting boulders. Now imagine that you are a child. You spend your days climbing around, playing sports, sprinting. The body will grow in response to that stimulation, and you will become stronger, faster and fitter to achieve those tasks. This is why I believe that anyone can become reasonably fit. It just takes certain stimuli to encourage that fitness growth, and it is up to the parents of the child to provide it to them. If I could redo my childhood, I would have spent more time building up fitness, and would just take up any sport, as you would eventually get better at it. There is no such thing as zero talent, as my guitar and skateboarding skills has proven otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="consistency">Consistency</h2>
<p>Of course, change is only possible when you keep doing the same thing every day. It is suprising at how much results you get by doing a singular physical activity daily. Be consistent, in whatever you are doing. Do it every day, and you will reap the rewards from it. The previously cited example, Milo of Croton, lifted the calf everyday until it grew into a raging bull. Because he did it everyday, his strength also grew proportionally. To build a reasonable level of physical fitness, we must perform the physical activity, no matter how badly we are at it, and we must do it every single day. Saitama from One Punch Man had the right idea; his training every single day would indeed be a great way to improve fitness and performance. It does not have to be grueling as well; just a simple 10 pushups and 10 pullups a day will have incredible effects.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>Being a calisthenics athlete, I will do these 3 simple exercises every single day.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 sets of pushups, each set to failure</li>
<li>2 set of pullups, each set to failure</li>
<li>2 sets of squats, each set to failure</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very simple training plan, and that is the point. You don&rsquo;t want to dread the workout and overtax your muscles. By following this routine, it ensures that the workout is not too taxing, so your muscles are able to recover the following day, and is hard enough that it stimulates muscle growth.
