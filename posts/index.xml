        <description>On Physical Fitness I was never an athletic individual. From childhood, I was never pushed to play sports, train, or do a lot of physical activities. Even playing around on the playground was a rare moment of bliss. Instead, I spent my days staring at a screen, playing Maplestory, O2Jam, Dungeon Siege and various other computer games, which probably contributed to my disastrous eyesight.
All this time I wondered if people are just genetically predisposed to either be athletic or not.</description>

        <description>Utter torment awaits those who seek mercy at the end of a grueling path. Face thine fate with head held high, chest puffed out, and a mind of sacrifice.

        <description>Days pass by like flowing water. The year is ending. Time flows like an unstoppable river, crushing everything within its way until it reaches the ocean. I am 23 years old. The average life expectancy for a male in my demographic is around 72 years old. Without realizing it, I am nearly halfway there. Halfway to an ending. My own father met death at the ripe age of 59. Perhaps I too might only be able to make it to that age.</description>
