        <description>&amp;ldquo;No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.&amp;rdquo;
Socrates

        <description>Days pass by like flowing water.
 The year is ending. Time flows like an unstoppable river, crushing everything within its way until it reaches the ocean. I am 23 years old. The average life expectancy for a male in my demographic is around 72 years old. Without realizing it, I am nearly halfway there. Halfway to an ending. My own father met death at the ripe age of 59.</description>
