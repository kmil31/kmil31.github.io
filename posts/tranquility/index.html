<p><strong>LOVELESS, ACT 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>It is my personal opinion that the smartphone is quite possibly the most damaging device ever invented</strong>. Whereas before, to access the global store of knowledge known as the Internet, we had to sit down and open our bulky and heavy computers, now we can easily and quickly access it anywhere. Never before has communication, research, and navigation been so easy. The smartphone has paved ways for technology and actions that could have been only been dreamt of in the greatest minds of science fiction authors. <em><strong>Objectively, the smartphone has been a net positive to society</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Subjectively speaking however, I feel as if the smartphone has degraded the cognitive capacity of the average human being. With access to smartphones being so universal, it has brought about a myriad of side effects that we are only beginning to understand. From my personal experience, I have noticed that my attention span and focus have suffered significantly after being a regular user of the smartphone. I can actively feel myself wanting to check my phone frequently, every 5 minutes or so it seems. Every notification must be checked, every tweet must be read. It has seriously affected my focus and I believe it is not only me that is suffering from this side-effect.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, this lack of focus applies to nearly everything I do in life. I can no longer read books for hours and hours upon a time. The urge to grab my phone and doomscroll is incredibly strong. Even as I am typing this short article, I am conscious of the urge to just grab my phone and look at it. Perhaps this is just a small taste of what any addict feels. If so, I can sympathise with them.</p>
<p>The barrage of information, ever ready to assault our cognitive senses has disrupted the fragile peace of the human mind. I would prefer it if the smartphone had actually never existed. A mobile phone, which can only play music, SMS and call, partnered with a laptop would be enough for me. But the reliance of the smartphone applications which have become ubiquitious have forced me to keep up with the times. It would be an interesting social experiment to see how long I could survive without a smartphone, before society forces me back into using them.</p>
