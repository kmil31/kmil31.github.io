        <description>&amp;ldquo;No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.&amp;rdquo;
Socrates
 I was never an athletic individual. From childhood, I was never pushed to play sports, train, or do a lot of physical activities. Even playing around on the playground was a rare moment of bliss.</description>

        <description>The wandering mind knows no rest
LOVELESS, ACT 2
 It is my personal opinion that the smartphone is quite possibly the most damaging device ever invented. Whereas before, to access the global store of knowledge known as the Internet, we had to sit down and open our bulky and heavy computers, now we can easily and quickly access it anywhere. Never before has communication, research, and navigation been so easy.</description>

        <description>Days pass by like flowing water.
 The year is ending. Time flows like an unstoppable river, crushing everything within its way until it reaches the ocean. I am 23 years old. The average life expectancy for a male in my demographic is around 72 years old. Without realizing it, I am nearly halfway there. Halfway to an ending. My own father met death at the ripe age of 59.</description>
